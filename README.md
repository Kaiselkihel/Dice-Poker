# Dice-Poker
This is a Dice Poker game I have made after 4 days of JavaScript class.
It is a variation of a mini game found in such games as Uncharted Water 2 and the Witcher series.
I will be updating this game to be more efficient than it was when I handed in 4 months ago.

Got 98% for my JavaScript project at British Columbia Institute of Technology.
