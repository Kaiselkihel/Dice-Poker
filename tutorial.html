			<h1>1. Betting Phase</h1>
			<p>Start the game by placing the bet. Initially you can bet any amount between $10 and $200. When the computer calls your bet, 'ROLL' button will become active and you can start the game.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>2. Initial Rolling Phase</h1>
			<p>You and the computer roll five dice. You go first then after getting your initial hand, computer goes next. After the computer finishes his roll, 'REROLL' and 'KEEP' button will become active and Rerolling Phase begins.</p>
			<p>When you're unsure of how good your hand is, refer to 'SCORE REFERENCE' but basically higher hand will win. If both hands match, the highest face-value prevails: <span class="italic">e.g. if you have a Pair of 3s and your opponent has a Pair of 4s, you lose.</span> 'Extra' dice (in the case of Pairs or Three-/Four-of-a-Kind) are only considered if matching hands are identical: <span class="italic">e.g. if each player has four 6s, your fifth die is a 3 and your opponent's is a 1, you win.</span> If both you and the computer end with all five dice matching, it's a draw.</p>
		</div>

			<h1>3. Rerolling Phase</h1>
			<p>If you're unahppy with your initial hand, you can select any number of dice to Reroll. You can do this by pressing the 'REROLL' buttons underneath each die. 'REROLL' button will change to small 'KEEP' and use this when you make a mistake. After you finish selecting the desired dice, press 'ROLL' again to reroll those dice.</p>
			<p>If you're happy with your hand and do not wish to reroll any die, then press big 'KEEP' button to keep your hand. Computer will finish his turn on his own.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>4. Result</h1>
			<p>If you're still unsatisfied with your hand after the first rerolling phase, you have one more chance to reroll your dice. When the Last Rerolling Phase is over, whoever has the higher hand gets the pot. If it's a tie, then the pot stays and the winner of the next round gets the pot plus the new bet.</p>
			<p>When the player press 'CONTINUE' then the new round begins and this time, the computer goes first. However the process is the same; only now you're reacting to the computer's roll. When the computer bets, please match his bet.</p>
